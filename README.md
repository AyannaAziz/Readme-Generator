## Challenges 
This particular application was pretty straightforward once I understood how inquirer works. The next logical concept I had to grasp was how I should capture the responses and where the responses were being rendered. Another aspect that was particularly challenging was getting the badge to show for the licensing. However after some expert level Googling I was able to find a syntax that worked.
