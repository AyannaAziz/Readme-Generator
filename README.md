## Weather-Dashboard
ReadMe Generator is a command line application that allows a user to enter information about a GitHub project and then easily generate a professional and organized Readme.  

## Description
The server-side API used to get response data object is retrieved from the Open Weather APi. The current weather section includes the following weather attributes and date.

* City, Date, Icon image
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind Speed
* UV index

The 5-days weather forecast includes the following information for each day:

* Date
* Icon image
* Temperature
* Humidity

The local storage is used to store the previously searched cities and display them to the user in the left side of the page under the search bar.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JQuery
* Open Weather API

## Demo

## Challenges 
In order to get all the information needed, a good deal of manipulation of the response from the get request was needed, including taking information from one response to generate a new request. For example, the search based on city name returns latitude and longitude coordinates, and these coordinates are used in the UV Index get request.
